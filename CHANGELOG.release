v1.5 | ? ? 2013:
[TODO] pre-release test on varied distros (e.g: RHEL4,5,6, Debian 6,7, Ubuntu 11,12,13 ...)
[TODO] update README file
[TODO] scan statistics submissions
[TODO] make installer portable to any path structure
[TODO] conversion function for custom user rules into clamav format
[TODO] execute cleaner rules with signature name as argument, standard wrapper format of signature rules
       checks ($2) for matching signature name to apply cleaner
[TODO] search domain logs on hit file names and ban addresses
[TODO] add /usr/share/clamav to clamscan database checks; use two -d options , one for maldet sigs other for clam sigs
       instead of the current per-sigfile -d arguments
[TODO] add set of test files and a selftest function to ensure scan detection is working properly - include both
       clean and known-malware files; if clean files return bad, invalidate install hashes and force update/reinstall.
       If known-malware files return clean, test w/clamscan enabled/disabled to see if its an issue with the clamav
       integration; if clamav integration returns as the issue, disable it and fallback to LMD internal scanner engine
[TODO] test / removed empty lines from ignore files
[TODO] consider software version alert / detection
[TODO] consider alert / optional action on world-write files and paths
[TODO] do not allow scanning of maldet installation path as results in FP's from cleaner rules and future selftest rules
[TODO] URL import feature in conf.maldet for user custom signatures
[TODO] ensure proper support for ./ and explicit file/directory searches
[TODO] change all absolute path definitions (e.g: /usr/bin/wget) to use which to find the path or assume $PATH
       already knows where to find said binaires
[TODO] add configuration option that toggles version updates off/on [default on]
[TODO] add configuration option that toggles signature updates off/on [default on]
[TODO] rename variables in conf.maldet to provide some semblance of consistency across associated variable types
       e.g: all scanner variables as scan_*, all quarnatine variables quar_*, etc...
[TODO] review every function to strip of unnecessary code/legacy code support and modernize/streamline where possible
[TODO] add gzip support for all signature downloads, average of 2.8x reduction in size

[New] added -i|--include-regex CLI option for run-time path/file inclusion based on posix-egrep regular expressions
[New] added -x|--exclude-regex CLI option for run-time path/file exclusion based on posix-egrep regular expressions
[New] added scan_nice conf.maldet option to control CPU Nice value of all scan operations (find, clamscan, md5sum etc..)
[New] added support for custom signature files for md5 and hex signatures which will be preserved across signature updates
      and installation upgades; files are located at:
      sigs/custom.md5.dat
      sigs/custom.hex.dat
[New] custom signature perform run-time conversion into ClamAV compat. signatures on systems that use clamscan engine
[New] new md5 signature format (md5v2) now includes file size that an md5 hash was derived from in format of:
      hash:filesize:signame
[New] added support for custom cleaner rules to be executed on clean events, file name format of
      "clean/custom.signame"; rules are preserved across signature and version updates
[New] added set of defined exit codes for errored exits(1), successful runs with hits(2), successful runs with no hits(0)
[New] added uninstall.sh script to maldetect installation path
[Change] modified '-e|--report list' output include total files scanned, hits and cleaned results, reversed output order and
         consistent column spacing (column -t)
[Change] moved tlog executable out of inotify/ path, changed inotify_log path to logs/, removed inotify directory
[Change] created logs/ path, moved event_log path to logs/
[Change] modified previous wget timeout values of 3s timeout & 3 retries to 5s timeout & 3 retries
[Change] wget timeout and retry attempts are now configurable through internals.conf wget_timeout & wget_retries variables
[Change] modified native LMD scanner to better leverage bash internal field separator for handling of paths with spaces
[Change] removed file type check on native LMD stage2 hex scanner which was part of legacy code and no longer needed
[Change] removed verbose progressive scan output for native LMD scanner as performance penalty was unreasonable
[Change] replaced usage of tmpwatch with find in cron.daily for temporary path pruning
[Change] removed internals.conf from version check hashing
[Change] cron.daily now tests for directadmin and scans appropriate user domain paths
[Change] directory checkout uploads limited to maximum of 50 files
[Change] added tmpdir_scan and tmpdir_paths to explicitly scan known temporary (world-write) paths on -r|--recent and
         -a|--all scan types
[Change] updated example ModSecurity rule in README file for compatibility with ModSec 2.7 which now requires
         every rule, even hooks, to have a rule ID
[Change] -r|--recent scans now use ctime, instead of mtime, file attributes to find recently modified files
[Change] LMD v1.4.2+ will now use the new md5 v2 signature format and make direct requests on signature
         updates to the appropriate upstream file (md5v2.dat); old format, md5 v1, preserved in signature
         releases for compatibility of pre-1.4.2 releases
[Change] modified hexfifo.pl & hexstring.pl to accept user supplied value for path to hex signature file
[Change] install.sh now deletes LMD backup installation copies older than 30days
[Change] references to www.rfxn.com for remote signature and version updates now query cdn.rfxn.com
[Change] cleaner rules are now executable scripts in which infected files are passed as an argument ($1)
         allowing for a diverse set of cleaner rule options apart from the previous sed only setup
[Change] converted current cleaner rules to new executable scripts format
[Change] checkout uploads now store malware in the filename format of (hostid is an anonymous md5 identifier):
         $hostid.$RANDOM.$filename.[ascii|bin]
[Change] inotifywait from inotify-tools is no longer packaged with LMD, it should be downloaded in binary or
         source form from:
         https://github.com/rvoicilas/inotify-tools/wiki/
         binary versions are also available from dag repo at:
         http://pkgs.repoforge.org/inotify-tools/
[Change] internals.conf will now attempt to detect the path to inotifywait from $PATH
[Change] inotify max_user_watches was static set to 128, now configurable with inotify_user_watches
[Change] inotify values for max_user_instances|watches will first be checked and only modified if the existing
         values are lower than what maldet requires
[Fix] modified error output for missing inotifywait to display URL to inotify-tools github page
[Fix] suppressed ignore signature count being displayed when calling with --modsec
[Fix] pidof was being called without explicit path causing errors on systems with non-standard $PATH values
[Fix] set modsec.sh to use /bin/bash as interpreter instead of /bin/sh for compatibility
[Fix] removed MAILTO & SHELL variables from crons which were causing crond 'bad minute' errors on some systems
